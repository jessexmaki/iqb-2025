        "*This tutorial was written by Jessica Nash (Software Scientist) at The Molecular Sciences Software Institue for the [Cheminformatic-Driven Molecular Docking Workshop](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/news/67d9853eaddf75595bd158f7) held as a Crash Course with the Institute for Quantitative Biomedicine (IQB) and the Protein Data Bank (PDB). This notebook is Part 4 of 4 in the notebook series.*\n",

        "In this notebook, we will perform molecular docking of our original bound ligand along with the ligands we prepared in the last notebook.\n",
        "Molecular docking is a computational method that predicts the preferred orientation of one molecule (the ligand) when bound to another molecule (the receptor, often a protein).\n",
        "\n",
        "For docking, we will use a program called [gnina](https://github.com/gnina/gnina). gnina is pronounced `nee-na` (silent g) and is a fork of a software program called smina, which is itself a fork of Autodock Vina.\n",
        "For those unfamiliar with software development lingo, a \"fork\" is a copy of a project. Forks may be modified and diverge from the original project.\n",
        "Autodock Vina is the program we used for docking in last year's PDB Crash Course.\n",
        "\n",
        "smina was created from AutoDock Vina in order to allow easier set up of docking calculations as well as to allow more customization of the scoring function. smina allows you to set the binding site automatically based on distance from a ligand as well as to define your own scoring functions. gnina builds on that by adding rescoring with convoluational neural networks to improve pose prediction. In this notebook, we will use gnina.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Sampling: The algorithm explores many possible positions and orientations (or \"poses\") of the ligand within the receptor's active site. In AutoDock Vina, smina, and gnina, conformations are generated using Monte Carlo Sampling.\n",
        "2. Scoring: Each generated pose is evaluated using a scoring function which estimates the binding affinity. Poses are then ranked on these scores, with lower energy scores indicating more favorable interactions.\n",

These deep learning models analyze a 3D grid representation of the protein-ligand complex, essentially evaluating a \"picture\" of the interaction based on atomic densities.\n",
        "\n",
        "By default, gnina uses results from the CNN for **rescoring**, meaning that poses are initially sampled and scored with the traditional Vina scoring function but re-ranked after sampling using CNN models.
